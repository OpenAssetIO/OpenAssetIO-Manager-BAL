The implementation of the "basic asset library" manager.

See __init__.py for more details on it's high-level approach.

@info This code is a sketch to facilitate testing and sample workflows.
It should never be considered in any way a "good example of how to write
an asset management system". Consequently, it omits a plethora of "good
engineering practice".
